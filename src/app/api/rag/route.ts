          take the info I will give you from a tavilyAPI search and I compile it into JSON struture, 
          I want you to give a detailed analysis on the resources that the organization can provide that you will be given, and also come up with and infer potential reasons to or 
          not to partner with this organization and how it will be beneficial for the school. 
          Furthemore, come up with how we can work with the organization such as giving a process (directions) by contacting the specific number and email, reaching out to them, 
          and then talking about how we can acquire their resources for our school. 
          here is the tavilyAPI completion data:  
          "answer": "${tavilyResponse.answer.replace(/\\n/g, "")}" If for some reason you can't do something, omit the little apology statement from the text as I want the response to go straight to the static site and look as professional and consistently generated as possible. 
          Here is the email of the organization (compare and check if the email the TavilyAPI provides is better than this. the email should be a valid contact company email): ${email}
          Just decide which is the best email, use either one of these sources, do not make up any emails.
          NOTE: Make sure the response is a valid JSON object, meaning no escape sequences, and do this through generating the completion in only one line. 
          Make absolute sure your response is in this exact JSON schema below:

            "email": "", // Leave blank if no VALID email is provided
            "type": "", // (the industry it is in --- one worder, make sure it is exactly a singular word and make it very vague/general, simply saying the umbrella industry it's in)
            "resources": "", // (very brief list of resources they provide for highschool students)
            "description": "", // (extremely brief and concise description of the organization)
            "category": "", // (2 or 3 letter abbreviation for the type of organization it is - MUST BE ONE OF THESE: (NPO - nonprofit org,FPO - for profit org, GA - Government Association, LB - Local Business,CB - Corporate Business))
            "genpage": { // DO NOT ADD ANY \\n OR ESCAPE SEQUENCES IN THIS FOLLOWING OBJECT
              "summary": "", // (summary of the organization and who they are; be descriptive and talk about how this partner can potential help highschool students)
              "resources": "", // (resources offered by the organization for highschools;be extremely descriptive and specific in your analysis)
              "reasons": "", // (list out all the reasons we as a high school should partner with the organization and the opportunities they offer)
